# What is Solana Learning Base?

This website aims to share knowledge about Solana development ecosystem based on real issues that we have working with it. The initial idea of this project was to create resources for new employees at our company, but making this open-source is better for the community and the team.

# How does it work?

We create some articles or simple explanation posts for things that we think should be better explained or curiosities that are unknown by many developers.

# What technologies?

We use and write about Solana on-chain BPF programs(A.K.A Smart Contracts), Anchor Framework, Rust language, Solana Web3.js and related things.
